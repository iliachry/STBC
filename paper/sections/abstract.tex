This paper presents a systematic framework for constructing and optimizing  high-performance 4x4 Space-Time Block Codes (STBCs) from biquaternion
division algebras. 
The framework guarantees full transmit diversity while enabling tunable
transmission rates through rigorous left regular representation of algebraic elements. 
Our core contributions include a comprehensive theoretical analysis of detector performance, deriving analytical BER expressions and complexity bounds for both classical and novel detection algorithms. 
By systematically optimizing the key algebraic parameter $\gamma$ that governs quaternion algebra interaction, we achieve measurable coding gain improvements across all detection schemes. 
Simulation results for rate-2 QPSK designs show that while optimal ML detection provides modest gains ($\sim$0.2 dB), practical linear detectors reveal substantial benefits: 
MMSE detection achieves 1.0 dB improvement and ZF detection shows 2.0 dB gains at $10^{-5}$ BER. 
This work bridges theory and practice by explaining why optimization impact varies with system implementation choices, providing valuable guidance for real-world STBC deployment.
