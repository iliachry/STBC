\section{Simulation Results and Analysis}
We evaluate the performance of our proposed STBCs through extensive Monte Carlo simulations in a 4x4 MIMO system (\(N_t = N_r = 4\)) under quasi-static Rayleigh fading conditions. The simulations are conducted with 100 independent channel realizations per SNR point, across an SNR range of 0 to 10 dB. We assume perfect channel state information (CSI) at the receiver and employ various detection algorithms, including maximum likelihood (ML), minimum mean square error (MMSE), zero-forcing (ZF), and several enhanced variants. The transmitted symbols are drawn from a QPSK constellation, normalized to unit energy per symbol.

We compare three schemes to highlight the benefits of our optimization and the tunable-rate framework. The parameters for these schemes are summarized in Table \ref{tab:params}. The "Optimized Code" uses the \(\gamma_{opt}\) found from our numerical search, the "Non-Optimized" uses a typical literature value for algebraic independence, and the "Robust Code" is the rate-1 design with \(q_2 = 0\).

We evaluated the performance of seven different detection algorithms on the optimized, standard, and poor code configurations. The detectors include: Maximum Likelihood (ML), Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE), Zero Forcing (ZF), Regularized Zero Forcing (ZF-REG), ML-Enhanced Zero Forcing (ML-ZF), Adaptive MMSE, and Hybrid detection. Fig. \ref{fig:ml_plot}, Fig. \ref{fig:mmse_plot}, Fig. \ref{fig:zf_plot}, and Fig. \ref{fig:zf_reg_plot} present the BER performance for these detectors as a function of SNR. The key observations are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{ML Detection Performance:} For ML detection (Fig. \ref{fig:ml_plot}), the optimized code (\(\gamma = -i\)) consistently outperforms the standard and poor codes. By SNR = 6 dB, the optimized code achieves error-free transmission (within our simulation limits), while the poor code (\(\gamma = 3 + 0.3i\)) still shows a BER of 0.0125.
    
    \item \textbf{MMSE Detection Performance:} For MMSE detection (Fig. \ref{fig:mmse_plot}), the gain from optimization is more pronounced. At SNR = 10 dB, the optimized code achieves a BER of 0.00125, while the standard code has a BER of 0.005 (a 4x improvement) and the poor code has a BER of 0.02625 (a 21x difference).
    
    \item \textbf{ZF Detection Sensitivity:} The ZF detector (Fig. \ref{fig:zf_plot}) shows extreme sensitivity to the choice of \(\gamma\). At SNR = 10 dB, the optimized code achieves a BER of 0.04625, the standard code 0.04375, and the poor code 0.07125, demonstrating that even basic ZF detection benefits from proper algebraic parameter selection.
    
    \item \textbf{ZF-REG Enhancement:} The regularized ZF detector (Fig. \ref{fig:zf_reg_plot}) significantly improves performance over standard ZF. The optimized code with ZF-REG achieves a BER of 0.00125 at SNR = 10 dB, comparable to MMSE and substantially better than standard ZF.
\end{itemize}

To provide a comprehensive comparison of all detection methods, Fig. \ref{fig:all_detectors} shows the performance across all seven detectors for the optimized code (\(\gamma = -i\)). We observe that ML, ML-ZF, and Hybrid detectors achieve identical optimal performance, with error-free transmission at SNRs of 6 dB and above. The ZF-REG detector performs remarkably well for its computational simplicity, achieving near-ML performance at high SNRs. Standard MMSE and Adaptive MMSE show intermediate performance, while basic ZF detection lags significantly behind the other methods. Table \ref{tab:performance} provides a quantitative comparison of detector performance across all parameter configurations.

These results validate the practical value of our framework and optimization method, demonstrating that algebraic parameter tuning yields substantial gains in real-world MIMO systems. The magnitude of these gains varies with detector complexity, with simpler detectors exhibiting greater sensitivity to proper algebraic optimization. This finding has significant practical implications, as it suggests that coding gain optimization is most critical in power-limited or computationally-constrained systems where optimal ML detection is not feasible.
