\section{Conclusion}
This paper has addressed the critical but often overlooked issue of coding gain optimization in the design of algebraic STBCs for 4x4 MIMO systems. We began by presenting a flexible framework for constructing tunable-rate STBCs from biquaternion division algebras, which provides a solid foundation for achieving both full diversity and high spectral efficiency. The core contribution of our work was the introduction of a systematic method to maximize the code's performance by optimizing a key algebraic parameter, \(\gamma\).

Our simulation results have conclusively demonstrated the practical value of this approach. By moving beyond arbitrary parameter choices and performing a structured numerical search, we identified an optimal \(\gamma\) that yields a significant 1.5 dB performance gain for a rate-2 QPSK design over a non-optimized baseline. This improvement is particularly noteworthy as it is achieved without any additional implementation complexity, power, or bandwidth, effectively unlocking the full potential of the underlying algebraic structure. This work shows that for algebraic codes, a focus on the geometric properties of the codeword space is not merely a theoretical exercise but an essential step toward practical, high-performance designs.

Looking ahead, this optimized framework serves as a launchpad for two promising research avenues. The first is the development of low-complexity decoders. While ML decoding was used here for performance evaluation, its complexity is a barrier to the practical deployment of our high-rate codes. Future work should investigate lattice-reduction-aided decoders tailored to the specific structure of our optimized biquaternion codes. The second direction is to leverage the framework's tunable rate to design a full adaptive transmission scheme. Such a system could dynamically switch between the highly robust rate-1 mode and the high-throughput, optimized rate-2 mode, thereby maximizing system throughput across varying channel conditions and creating a truly intelligent and efficient communication system.
